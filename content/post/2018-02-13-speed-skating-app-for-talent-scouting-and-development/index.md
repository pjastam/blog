I published the code of the Shiny front-end to my speed skating app at GitHub [here](https://github.com/pjastam/shiny-speedskating). This app is useful for talent scouting & development of junior speed skaters. [Speed skating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_skating) is a popular winter sport in [the Netherlands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlands). You can find more about the why and how of this app in the README markdown at my GitHub site. You can find an interactive demo of the app [here](https://pjastam.shinyapps.io/speedskating/).
