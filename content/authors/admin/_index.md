I founded the boutique consulting firms Equalis Strategy & Modeling and SiRM - Strategies in Regulated Markets. My area of expertise is building bridges between economic science and daily practice in health care & insurance. I am straightforward and connect stakeholders based on content and shared interests. My independent role is important to me, after all, the higher societal goal is paramount.
